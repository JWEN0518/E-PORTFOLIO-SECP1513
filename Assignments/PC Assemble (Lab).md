### REFLECTION

Through learning the process of assembling a PC, I have gained valuable information and knowledge about being patient and careful when installing its components. Errors during assembly may lead to the CPU not functioning properly. This experience provided me with a great opportunity to understand the various components of the CPU and how to effectively assemble a PC. Assembling a PC requires a high level of concentration to avoid installing components in the wrong positions. Therefore, this underscores the importance of precision in the assembly process.This hands-on experience has improved my understanding of the functions of each part.

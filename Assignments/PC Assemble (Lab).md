### REFLECTION

Throught learning this PC assemble, I had learned and gained a lot of information and knowledge about patient and careful when installing the component of the PC. The CPU might not work when we assemble erorr like the we  the structure of the CPU and how to assemble the PC. Throughout the PC assemble, it required a high concentration ability,install the component in wrong position.Therefore, this underscores the importance of precision in the assembly process.

Besides, building the computer with my hands helped me turn vague ideas about the CPU, motherboard, RAM, and GPU into real things I can touch. This made me understand better what each part does and how they work together.
